**Standard Bank Software Engineering Project**

This project encompasses four key tasks, each contributing to the improvement and security of the mobile banking application. 

**Task 1: Token-Based Authentication**

In Task 1, I focused on implementing token-based authentication to enhance the security of the mobile app. By integrating JWTs into the authentication process, we've significantly improved the app's resistance to unauthorized access. This task not only bolstered my knowledge of authentication methods but also honed my Java programming skills.

**Skills Gained:**
- Authentication
- Java
- Security

**Task 2: Encoding Faces Within Images**

Task 2 delved into the realm of biometric authentication. By developing the capability to identify and encode faces within images, I've made the mobile authentication process more robust and user-friendly. This task introduced me to the exciting field of facial recognition, where I applied Python programming and leveraged AWS Lambda for efficient image processing.

**Skills Gained:**
- Authentication
- Python
- AWS Lambda

**Task 3: Data Management and Querying**

Task 3 revolved around data management and querying from our Teradata database. I acquired valuable skills in writing SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and present data efficiently. This newfound proficiency in database interaction and SQL querying will undoubtedly benefit the application's data-related functionalities.

**Skills Gained:**
- SQL
- Data Management
- Databases

**Task 4: Creating Personalised Views**

In Task 4, I worked on creating personalized views for the mobile app, abstracting complex database queries. Leveraging the Django framework and adhering to the MVC architecture, I optimized the user experience by simplifying how data is retrieved and presented. This task deepened my understanding of web application development using Python.

**Skills Gained:**
- Django
- MVC Architecture
- Python
